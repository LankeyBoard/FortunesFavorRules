This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Local Development with Netlify

Before you begin, make sure you complete the following if you haven’t already:

- [Install](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#installation) the Netlify CLI.
- [Authenticate](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#authentication) with an access token.
- Link your local project to a Netlify `siteID`. To do this, set up [continuous deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#continuous-deployment) with `netlify init` or [link an existing Netlify site](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#link-and-unlink-sites) with `netlify link`.
  To start a local development server for the build tool you’re using, run the following command from the root of your linked repository:

```bash
netlify dev
```

Check the [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/local-development/) for more info.
