    "text": "Tests are how you determine the outcome of uncertain events, can you smash open a door (Mettle), talk a guard into looking the other way (Heart), dodging a tomato hurled at your head (Agility).\nFirst the success and failure points of the test is set by the GM (Game Master) and the general outcome of success and failure are announced if it is reasonable for the player characters to know. Then players can decide if they want to attempt the test. The player then rolls 1d20 and adds their stat bonus to the result. If the result is at least equal to the success point, they pass the test and have a beneficial outcome. If the result is greater than or equal to the failure point but worse than the success, then the result is mixed. The GM can offer success with a cost or mixed success. If the results are less than the failure pint, the result is a failure. In general the failure point is five less than the success point.",
